# correlation analysis

# use Spearman (vi assume normal distribution, which we DON'T have)
# below: show Matt. Add to paper... Weird correlation for CHR
# SÃ¸ren: Use this plot. R^2 might be enough.
# ask matt: log-log vs R^2.. Log-log might not be ideal with our distribution...

# colour by:
## herd size
## disease/treatment (mastitis etc): This could be use to explain the below
## several days treatment. This could explain: maybe the farmer only register once.. and not the following days..
## Add disease group


# Spearman correlation CHR:
cor_herd <- cor(df_CHR$UDD, df_CHR$ADD, method = "spearman")
cor.test(df_CHR$UDD, df_CHR$ADD, method = "spearman")
hist(df_CHR$UDD)
hist(df_CHR$ADD)

plot(df_CHR$ADD ~ df_CHR$UDD, xlim=c(0,500), ylim=c(0,500))



# Spearman correlation ATC:
cor_atc <- cor(df_ATC$UDD, df_ATC$ADD)
cor.test(df_ATC$UDD, df_ATC$ADD, method = "spearman")

hist(df_ATC$UDD)
hist(df_ATC$ADD)

plot(df_ATC$ADD ~ df_ATC$UDD, xlim=c(0,500), ylim=c(0,500))
